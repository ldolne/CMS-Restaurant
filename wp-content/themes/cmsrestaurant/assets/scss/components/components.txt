Components (or modules): holds all of your styles for buttons, carousels, sliders, and similar page components (think widgets).
Your project will typically contain a lot of component files â€” as the whole site/app should be mostly composed of small modules.

Ex.
_buttons.scss      // Buttons
_carousel.scss     // Carousel
_slider.scss        // Slider
